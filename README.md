C# XMPIE uStore Delayed Recipient List Plugin

This sample plugin allows you to use the XMPIE uStore delayed recipient list plugin as a backend component to order, download, and assemble the recipient list for a uStore order.

This is the first and possibly the only example of how to create this plugin in uStore.
